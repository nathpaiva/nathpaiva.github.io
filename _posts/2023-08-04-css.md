# Hello, I'm back!

This is my first post after a long time, and I'm really excited about it. I'm back to the blog because I want to develop my writing skills and also be prepared to do interviews in the future.

Last year I've moved to Canada, and I was working as as Senior Software Engineer in a new product in a start up, unfortunately the product didn't work out, and I was laid off. So I've decided to take some time off to study and improve my skills and be prepared for my next role.

Sometimes interview scares me a lot. Even though I've been working with software development for a long time, on interviews I freeze and I can't show my abilities as I should do. So I've decided to start writing about what I'm studying and what I'm learning, and also share some tips about how to prepare for it.

So the next posts I will be answering some questions that I've been asked in interviews, and also some tips about how to prepare for it.

I hope you enjoy it, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.

Take care, and see you soon! ðŸ‘‹
