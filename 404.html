    <p>We hope you are doing better than this emoji <span class="emoji-big">ðŸ« </span> and much better than this <strong>melting woman</strong> on her
      worst day after being laid off after 12 years of working as a software engineer and facing this new feeling.</p>

      <img alt="Nath's picture laid down on the floor" src="/assets/nathpaiva-melting.jpeg" />
    </div>

    <p>In the meanwhile, we would like to recommend a few posts:</p>

    <ul class="post-list">
      {% for post in site.posts | limit:2 %}
        <li>
          <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
