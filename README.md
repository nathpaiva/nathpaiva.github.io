Content I'm creating about the technologies I'm studying at the moment.


## To start

You need to have a environment of Jekyll. [Click here to prepare environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)


```bash
bundle update --bundler
```

After installation run in the terminal:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
